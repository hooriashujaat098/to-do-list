# To Do List App

This is a simple To Do List app built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed and delete them. The tasks are saved in localStorage, so they stay even after refreshing the page.

## Features

* Add new tasks
* Mark tasks as completed
* Delete tasks
* Save tasks using localStorage
* Clean and simple user interface

## What I Learned

While building this project, I practiced:

* DOM manipulation
* Event handling
* Working with localStorage
* Handling user input
* Updating UI dynamically

This project helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements and how to manage data in the browser.

## How to Use

1. Open the app in your browser
2. Type a task in the input field
3. Press Enter to add the task
4. Click the check icon to mark it as completed
5. Click the trash icon to delete it
